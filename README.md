# translationdiff

The overall objective is to understand what makes a text difficult to translate.
Can we modify or improve existing methods?

### Things to try:
- Linear regression using Biber dimensions (predicting words per day)
- Prediction of MT errors and it's relation to text difficulty
- Test QEBrain
- Semi-supervised approaches and NN
- Visualisation of multidimensional data
